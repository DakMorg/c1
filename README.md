## Description

For this project I was given starter code that was hard to read, and needed to be formatted better so that anyone using a screen
reader could have a more enjoyable experience interacting with the website.

- What was your motivation?
To make the code clean and easy to read.

- What problem does it solve?
The original code was hard to read, and would have made the website confusing for anyone using a screen reader to view the site.

- What did you learn?
I learned the importance of using semantic html elements. Not only does it help people using screen readers, but it also 
helped me to better read the code and understand what each part of the code is doing. 
In short, this assignment showed me the value of writing clean code.
